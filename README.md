* **ds.sh** : Detached shell laucher, improving &, with log support
* **bootstrap-tmux.sh** : I use it as shell interpreter in guake, and embedded in .bashrc at remote servers
* **parallel.sh** : I use it mostly to query many servers at same time, but it can run any kind of repetitive command in parallel rather than sequentially, which means much more speed in many cases
* **ssh-tmux.sh** : I use it to connect to many servers to hack them simultaneously, a la terminator broadcast
* **install-functions.sh** : helper lib around the system package manager (apt/dpkg version only yet)
* **string-functions.sh** : string utilities (tolower, toupper)
